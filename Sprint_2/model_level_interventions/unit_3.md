# Unit 3: Regularization for Fairness  

---

## 1. Conceptual Foundation and Relevance  

### Guiding Questions  
- **Q1.** How can fairness objectives be incorporated into model training as regularization terms rather than strict constraints, and what advantages does this flexibility provide?  
- **Q2.** What trade-offs emerge when balancing fairness regularization against model performance, and how can these be navigated effectively in practical applications?  

### Conceptual Context  
Regularization for fairness provides a **middle ground** between rigid constraint-based methods (Unit 1) and pre-processing approaches.  

- **Constraints** → hard boundaries (often inflexible, may harm performance).  
- **Regularization** → soft penalties for unfair behavior, balanced against accuracy.  

This creates a **continuous spectrum** of solutions instead of a binary “fair/unfair” model.  
- **Corbett-Davies & Goel (2018):** strict constraints may enable *fairness gerrymandering*.  
- **Regularization** → smoother optimization, adaptable to real-world contexts.  

Regularization builds on Unit 1’s optimization theory and complements Unit 2’s adversarial debiasing by offering a simpler, often more stable fairness mechanism.

## 2. Key Concepts  

### Fairness as Regularization Penalty  
- Add fairness penalty terms to loss function:  
  \[
  L_\text{combined} = L_\text{task} + \eta \cdot L_\text{fairness}
  \]  

- **Kamishima et al. (2012):** *prejudice remover* → penalize mutual information between predictions and protected attributes.  
- **Bechavod & Ligett (2017):** generalized penalties for demographic parity, equalized odds, etc.  

---

### Regularization Parameter Tuning  
- Parameter (λ or η) controls **balance** between accuracy and fairness.  
- Low λ → model prioritizes accuracy, tolerates unfairness.  
- High λ → model prioritizes fairness, may lose predictive power.  

**Hardt et al. (2016):** parameter tuning creates a **Pareto frontier** of fairness vs. performance.  
**Zafar et al. (2017):** regularization enables exploration of entire fairness–accuracy spectrum.  

---

### Group-Specific Regularization  
- Uniform penalties may overlook subgroup disparities.  
- **Group-specific λg** → apply stronger regularization to disadvantaged groups.  
- **Lahoti et al. (2020):** adaptive penalties improve *individual fairness*.  
- **Kearns et al. (2018):** subgroup penalties prevent *fairness gerrymandering*.  

---

### Fairness-Accuracy Trade-off Analysis  
- Regularization forces explicit **trade-offs**:  
  - Plot fairness vs performance.  
  - Identify *knee points* where small performance losses give large fairness gains.  
- **Kleinberg et al. (2016):** impossibility theorems → not all fairness metrics can coexist.  
- **Menon & Williamson (2018):** quantified fairness-performance costs.  

---

### Domain Modeling Perspective  
Regularization affects multiple ML pipeline components:  
- **Objective function** → fairness penalties added.  
- **Loss calculation** → fairness metrics computed per batch.  
- **Gradients** → fairness pushes updates alongside accuracy.  
- **Hyperparameters** → λ tuned like other model params.  
- **Evaluation** → expanded to fairness-performance trade-offs.  

---

### Intersectionality Consideration  
- Regularization must go beyond single attributes.  
- **Crenshaw (1989):** intersectionality.  
- **Kearns et al. (2018):** subgroup fairness → penalize disparities at intersections.  

Implementation:  
- Identify subgroup intersections.  
- Add intersectional regularization terms.  
- Weight penalties by subgroup size and vulnerability.  

---

## 3. Practical Considerations  

### Implementation Framework  
1. **Regularizer design**  
   - Demographic parity, equal opportunity, equalized odds penalties.  
   - Differentiable metrics → usable in gradient-based training.  

2. **Integration**  
   - Linear/logistic regression → add fairness penalties directly.  
   - Tree models → modify split criterion with fairness penalties.  
   - Neural networks → custom fairness-aware loss functions.  

3. **Parameter tuning**  
   - Explore λ with grid search, Bayesian optimization, or log-scale exploration.  
   - Visualize fairness-performance trade-off curves.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Test both performance and fairness.  
   - Compare against constraints/adversarial.  
   - Document trade-offs for stakeholders.  

---

### Implementation Challenges  
- **Non-convexity** → may cause poor convergence.  
- **Balancing multiple fairness goals** → composite regularizers needed.  
- **Computation** → requires more tuning experiments.  

---

### Evaluation Approach  
- Plot fairness vs accuracy → **Pareto frontier**.  
- Identify marginal cost of fairness.  
- Use stratified CV for subgroup robustness.  
- Test generalization under distribution shifts.

## 4. Case Study: Loan Approval Algorithm  

**Scenario Context**  
- Bank model for loan default risk.  
- Found disparities by race & gender.  
- Goal: balance **demographic parity** + **equal opportunity**.  

**Problem Analysis**  
- Constraints caused too many defaults (+12%).  
- Ignoring fairness → legal & reputational risks.  
- Regularization offered a flexible compromise.  

**Solution Implementation**  
- Composite regularizer for DP + EO.  
- Modified split criterion in gradient boosting.  
- λ tuning:  
  - λ=0 → 85% accuracy, 18% approval gap.  
  - λ=0.5 → 82% accuracy, 7% gap.  
  - λ=1.0 → 79% accuracy, 3% gap.  
- Group-specific regularization → stronger penalties for historically disadvantaged groups.  

**Outcomes**  
- Chose λ=0.3 → 65% disparity reduction, −2% accuracy.  
- Intersectional fairness improved 72%.  
- Visual Pareto curves helped stakeholders choose trade-off.  

**Lessons**  
- Trade-off analysis is critical.  
- Group-specific λ improves equity.  
- Composite regularizers help balance multiple fairness goals.

**Q2. Efficient parameter tuning?**  
- Use Bayesian optimization or log-scale λ search.  
- Warm-start with low λ, increase gradually.
